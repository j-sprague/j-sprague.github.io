Android fitness tracking app using Room API to store data and AnyChart for line chart visualizations. Both of these packages were new to me while developing this application. The user can add log entries, delete entries, and look at graphs that represent the data. Graphs are shown for sleep time, exercise time, sleep quality, and weight changes.
