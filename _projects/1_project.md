Java program that allows you to easily edit a stream overlay for a Smash Ultimate tournament. This is the first side project I've worked on that was not for any class assignment. Originally developed in 2021, this program was designed for an event organizer in the Charlotte area that wanted a tool to easily modify a scoreboard that's displayed on a broadcast. The program outputs text and image files that can be read by OBS, a software commonly used for livestreams.
