I am a software developer who recently earned a bachelor's degree from UNC Charlotte. My main interest within computer science is creating web applications, and more recently, android applications. I have experience working in Java, Python, JavaScript, NodeJS, Flask, and C++. I also have experience with managing databases running SQL and MongoDB, and web design languages HTML and CSS. 

I encourage you to check out my projects and reach out if you have any questions.
